## Cordis API

Generated from source by `scripts/gen-cordis-catalog.ts` (verified fresh by `pnpm run verify-cordis-catalog` in doc-sync; regenerate with `pnpm run gen-cordis-catalog`) — this section is byte-identical in both language sides of the page. Signature blocks use a `ts cordis-catalog` fence and keep the original source JSDoc; dispatch modes are defined in the [primer](../cordis-primer.md#dispatch-modes), and the framework-inherited `ctx` API lives in [cordis-api/inherited.md](../cordis-api/inherited.md).

### `ctx.llm` — `LlmRuntime`

The abstract `llm` service: an adapter registry plus a streaming model-call API, interceptable via the `llm/stream` waterfall.

```ts cordis-catalog
/**
 * Register an adapter for the given provider routes. Throws `LlmError` with code
 * `DUPLICATE_ADAPTER` if any provider already has an adapter (all-or-nothing).
 * Disposed with the fiber.
 * @param providers - every provider route this adapter should serve.
 * @param adapter - the adapter that streams calls for those providers.
 * @returns the disposer, carrying {@link AdapterRegistrationHandle.replace}.
 */
registerAdapter(providers: string[], adapter: LlmAdapter): AdapterRegistrationHandle

/**
 * Describe provider routes with a registered adapter.
 * @returns detached provider metadata in registration order.
 */
listProviders(): LlmProviderInfo[]

/**
 * Declare provider routes an adapter plugin can activate through
 * configuration. Registration is all-or-nothing: an empty list, invalid
 * entry, or a provider already declared by any registration throws
 * `LlmError` without registering the rest. Disposed with the fiber.
 * @param entries - every configurable provider this plugin owns.
 * @returns a handle that withdraws all of them, and can atomically replace them.
 */
registerConfigurableProviders(entries: readonly LlmConfigurableProvider[]): DirectoryRegistrationHandle

/**
 * List every declared configurable provider, registered or dormant.
 * @returns detached directory entries in declaration order.
 */
listConfigurableProviders(): LlmConfigurableProvider[]

/**
 * Offer to interrogate provider endpoints on behalf of the settings
 * namespace this plugin owns. The namespace is the key because that is what
 * a configuration surface already holds from the configurable-provider
 * directory, and because a provider being *added* has no route to name yet.
 * Disposed with the fiber.
 * @param settingsNs - the namespace whose profiles this discovery serves.
 * @param discover - interrogates one endpoint; must honor `request.signal`.
 * @returns the disposer that withdraws the offer.
 */
registerModelDiscovery( settingsNs: string, discover: (request: LlmModelDiscoveryRequest) => Promise<readonly LlmDiscoveredModel[]>, ): () => void

/**
 * Interrogate one provider endpoint for the models it advertises. The
 * request describes a draft, not a stored route, so nothing here reads or
 * writes settings or credentials — the caller owns both, and the reply is
 * candidate metadata a surface may offer for adoption.
 * @param settingsNs - namespace whose registered discovery serves this draft.
 * @param request - the endpoint, protocol, and one-shot credential to use.
 * @returns the advertised models, deduplicated in endpoint order.
 */
async discoverModels( settingsNs: string, request: LlmModelDiscoveryRequest, ): Promise<LlmDiscoveredModel[]>

/**

 * is advisory and never changes routing or request validation.
 * @param provider - registered provider route to inspect.
 * @returns detached model metadata in adapter-preferred order.
 */
async listModels(provider: string): Promise<LlmModelInfo[]>

/**
 * Resolve and validate all metadata from the adapter that owns one exact
 * route. The result is detached from adapter-owned objects; catalog
 * membership remains advisory and does not control request routing.
 * @param provider - registered provider route to inspect.
 * @param model - exact model id passed to the adapter.
 * @param signal - optional cancellation for adapter-owned asynchronous lookup.
 * @returns exact model identity plus available context and reasoning metadata.
 */
async resolveModelInfo( provider: string, model: string, signal?: AbortSignal, ): Promise<LlmResolvedModelInfo>

/**
 * Validate a conversation call config against its exact model capability and
 * materialize adapter-configured defaults. Unsupported explicit efforts
 * reject before provider I/O; no clamping or aliasing is performed. This
 * standalone query does not bind a later dispatch; use {@link prepareCall}
 * when logging and streaming must share one adapter registration.
 * @param config - provider/model route and optional request controls.
 * @param signal - optional cancellation for adapter-owned capability lookup.
 * @returns a detached config only when a default must be materialized.
 */
async resolveCallConfig(config: LlmCallConfig, signal?: AbortSignal): Promise<LlmCallConfig>

/**
 * Resolve one call under its current adapter registration. The returned
 * one-shot handle keeps that registration across header logging and dispatch,
 * so HMR cannot combine one adapter's capability result with another adapter.
 * @param config - provider/model route and optional request controls.
 * @param signal - optional cancellation for adapter-owned capability lookup.
 * @returns a prepared config and its registration-bound stream entry point.
 */
async prepareCall(config: LlmCallConfig, signal?: AbortSignal): Promise<PreparedLlmCall>

/**
 * Stream one model call as raw chunks (token-level deltas). Replay state is
 * retained only when the same adapter instance owns its historical provider
 * and the target provider. Final adapter selection remains fixed through
 * asynchronous exact-model resolution and dispatch. Adapter selection,
 * dispatch, and iteration failures become terminal `error` or `aborted`
 * finish chunks; middleware, nested-call, cleanup, and consumer failures
 * remain thrown.
 * @param options - the full request; `options.provider` selects the adapter.
 * @returns the chunk stream, possibly wrapped by `llm/stream` listeners.

### `llm/*` events

<a id="llmadapters-updated--emit"></a>

#### `llm/adapters-updated` — emit

The provider topology changed: an adapter registered or unregistered routes, or the configurable-provider directory gained or lost entries. This payload-free registry notification fires at each commit point (including registration disposal); consumers re-read `listProviders()`, `listModels()`, or `listConfigurableProviders()` for the new state. Observer failures are contained and cannot veto the registry mutation.

```ts cordis-catalog
/**

<a id="llmstream--waterfall"></a>

#### `llm/stream` — waterfall

Waterfall around every streaming model call (retry, replay, routing). Bound to the LlmRuntime; call `next()` to reach the resolved adapter's stream, or yield your own chunks to short-circuit.

```ts cordis-catalog
/**
 * Waterfall around every streaming model call (retry, replay, routing).
 * Bound to the {@link LlmRuntime}; call `next()` to reach the resolved
 * adapter's stream, or yield your own chunks to short-circuit.
 * @param options - the full request. A LOOP-built request carries the
 *   process-local {@link markAgentLoopRequest} identity and arrives deep-frozen
 *   (mutation throws): its content is a pure function of the session log (the
 *   reconstructability Agent Note), so listeners read it, never rewrite it.
 *   Hand-built calls do not carry that marker; their messages already obey
 *   the immutable creation contract.
 * @mode waterfall
