## Cordis API

Generated from source by `scripts/gen-cordis-catalog.ts` (verified fresh by `pnpm run verify-cordis-catalog` in doc-sync; regenerate with `pnpm run gen-cordis-catalog`) — this section is byte-identical in both language sides of the page. Signature blocks use a `ts cordis-catalog` fence and keep the original source JSDoc; dispatch modes are defined in the [primer](../cordis-primer.md#dispatch-modes), and the framework-inherited `ctx` API lives in [cordis-api/inherited.md](../cordis-api/inherited.md).

### `ctx.lsp` — `LspService`

The LSP capability seam (`ctx.lsp`). Owns provider registration/selection and normalized query execution; exposes exactly the four operations and no protocol escape hatch.

```ts cordis-catalog
/**
 * Register a provider, atomically reserving its id and every normalized extension. Any conflict
 * or invalid input publishes nothing and throws `LspError`; the returned disposer releases all
 * reservations. Disposed with the calling fiber.
 * @param provider - the backend to register.
 * @returns a synchronous disposer releasing the id and all extension reservations.
 */
registerProvider(provider: LspProvider): () => void

/**
 * Select a provider by the file's extension and run one query. Selection is per-query and
 * order-independent; no match throws `LspError` `LSP_UNAVAILABLE`.
 * @param request - the normalized query.
 * @param signal - optional cancellation forwarded to the selected provider.
 * @returns the normalized, closed-union result.
 */
query(request: LspQueryRequest, signal?: AbortSignal): Promise<LspQueryResult>
```
