## Cordis API

Generated from source by `scripts/gen-cordis-catalog.ts` (verified fresh by `pnpm run verify-cordis-catalog` in doc-sync; regenerate with `pnpm run gen-cordis-catalog`) — this section is byte-identical in both language sides of the page. Signature blocks use a `ts cordis-catalog` fence and keep the original source JSDoc; dispatch modes are defined in the [primer](../cordis-primer.md#dispatch-modes), and the framework-inherited `ctx` API lives in [cordis-api/inherited.md](../cordis-api/inherited.md).

### `ctx.fs` — `FileSystem` (abstract seam)

Abstract filesystem provider. Targets must preserve identity across aliases; reads expose regular UTF-8 text or typed errors, listings are stable and content-free, and mutations are atomic. Optional guards add stale protection without changing the unguarded provider contract.

```ts cordis-catalog
/**
 * Resolve a model/plugin-supplied path into a stable {@link FsTarget}. May perform I/O (a
 * remote/sandboxed backend may need a round-trip to map a path to a stable identity), hence
 * async even though the local backend only normalizes + realpaths.
 *
 * @param path - the path to resolve; relative paths resolve against `opts.cwd`.
 * @param opts - optional cwd override and cancellation signal.
 * @returns the stable target; the same file yields the same `targetKey`.
 */
abstract resolve(path: string, opts?: { cwd?: string; signal?: AbortSignal }): Promise<FsTarget>

/**
 * Return the canonical absolute path a subprocess in this filesystem's
 * execution world can open. The path is deliberately separate from
 * {@link FsTarget.targetKey}: consumers may pass this value to another OS
 * capability, but must continue treating the target key as opaque.
 * @param target - the resolved target whose process path is required.
 * @returns an absolute path in the backend's execution world.
 */
abstract processPath(target: FsTarget): string

/**
 * Return the canonical `file:` URI for a target in this filesystem's
 * execution world. Backends own URI encoding because the host platform may
 * differ from the execution platform.
 * @param target - the resolved target to encode.
 * @returns the target's canonical file URI.
 */
abstract fileUrl(target: FsTarget): string

/**
 * Test canonical containment without exposing or parsing backend target
 * keys. Both targets must come from this provider.
 * @param parent - canonical directory target.

/**

 */
abstract stat(target: FsTarget, signal?: AbortSignal): Promise<FsInfo | undefined>

/**
 * Return path metadata without following the final path component when it is a
 * symbolic link. This is intentionally path-shaped, not target-shaped:
 * {@link resolve} follows symlinks to produce the stable identity used by
 * normal reads/writes, while `lstat` lets a consumer reject the path itself
 * before that follow happens.
 *
 * `opts.cwd` follows {@link resolve}'s cwd rules. `undefined` means the path is
 * absent.
 * @param path - the path to inspect; relative paths resolve against `opts.cwd`.
 * @param opts - `cwd` overrides the backend's default base for relative paths.
 * @param signal - aborts the metadata round-trip.

 */
abstract readText(target: FsTarget, signal?: AbortSignal): Promise<string>

/**
 * Stream the whole regular text file as decoded text chunks (same text
 * semantics as {@link readText}, for large files). The backend owns
 * cross-chunk UTF-8 decoding and binary rejection so the policy layer never
 * touches raw bytes.
 * @param target - the resolved target to read.
 * @param signal - aborts the stream, including between chunks.
 * @returns the chunk iterable, decoded and validated like {@link readText}.
 */
abstract streamText(target: FsTarget, signal?: AbortSignal): Promise<AsyncIterable<string>>

/**
 * Read the whole regular file as raw bytes with no decoding or binary
 * rejection. The bound lives at this seam so a backend can never buffer an
 * unbounded file: a target known or discovered to exceed `maxBytes` fails
 * with `FS_TOO_LARGE` instead of returning a truncated result.
 * @param target - the resolved target to read.
 * @param signal - aborts the read.
 * @param maxBytes - inclusive byte cap on the complete content.
 * @returns the full raw content, at most `maxBytes` long.

 * child targets plus cheap metadata only; never reads file contents.

### `fs/*` events

<a id="fsedit-intent--waterfall"></a>

#### `fs/edit-intent` — waterfall

Single-slot decision for the next FileSystem.editText. Calling `next()` yields an unconditional edit; the first returned guard wins.

```ts cordis-catalog
/**
 * Single-slot decision for the next {@link FileSystem.editText}. Calling
 * `next()` yields an unconditional edit; the first returned guard wins.
 * @param target - the resolved target about to be edited.
 * @param actor - the opaque tool-execution context the decider keys off.
 * @mode waterfall

<a id="fsobserved--emit"></a>

#### `fs/observed` — emit

Record an authoritative positive or negative observation. Listeners must be synchronous recorders: throws fail the tool call and returned promises are not awaited.

```ts cordis-catalog
/**

 * be synchronous recorders: throws fail the tool call and returned promises

#### `fs/write-intent` — waterfall

Single-slot decision for the next FileSystem.writeText. Calling `next()` yields the bare provider's unconditional write; the first listener that returns an intent owns the decision rather than composing with peers.
