## Cordis API

Generated from source by `scripts/gen-cordis-catalog.ts` (verified fresh by `pnpm run verify-cordis-catalog` in doc-sync; regenerate with `pnpm run gen-cordis-catalog`) — this section is byte-identical in both language sides of the page. Signature blocks use a `ts cordis-catalog` fence and keep the original source JSDoc; dispatch modes are defined in the [primer](../cordis-primer.md#dispatch-modes), and the framework-inherited `ctx` API lives in [cordis-api/inherited.md](../cordis-api/inherited.md).

### `ctx.userQuestions` — `UserQuestionService`

`ctx.userQuestions`: one active UI provider plus an `ask()` API.

```ts cordis-catalog
/**
 * Register the UI provider. Only one provider may be active in a context.
 *
 * @param provider UI-side implementation that collects answers.
 * @returns Disposer that unregisters this provider.
 */
registerProvider(provider: UserQuestionProvider): () => void

/**
 * Ask the active UI provider and wait for the user's answer.
 *
 * When a caller supplies an agent, human interaction is valid only for the
 * exact live runtime root. Runtime ownership, not durable session lineage,
 * decides this boundary: an owned child has no human answerer and would
 * block forever, while a lineage-bearing session resumed as a new runtime
 * root may ask normally.
 *
 * @param request Questions, owner agent, and abort signal.
 * @returns The answer chosen or typed by the human.
 * @throws {UserQuestionError} code `CALLER_NOT_LIVE` when a supplied
 *   agent is not the registry's exact live instance, or `DELEGATED_CALLER`
 *   when that live agent is owned by another agent.
 */
async ask(request: AskUserQuestionRequest): Promise<AskUserQuestionAnswer>
