## Cordis API

Generated from source by `scripts/gen-cordis-catalog.ts` (verified fresh by `pnpm run verify-cordis-catalog` in doc-sync; regenerate with `pnpm run gen-cordis-catalog`) — this section is byte-identical in both language sides of the page. Signature blocks use a `ts cordis-catalog` fence and keep the original source JSDoc; dispatch modes are defined in the [primer](../cordis-primer.md#dispatch-modes), and the framework-inherited `ctx` API lives in [cordis-api/inherited.md](../cordis-api/inherited.md).

### `ctx.credentials` — `CredentialProvider` (abstract seam)

Abstract credential service. Providers implement the four operations over their source layers; one seam-wide rule binds them all: an empty stored value is absent everywhere — `resolve` skips it, `describe` reports it unconfigured — so a blank never masquerades as a configured secret.

```ts cordis-catalog
/**
 * Resolve one reference to its current value. Resolution is per call:
 * consumers re-resolve at each operation and must not cache across
 * operations — that per-operation read is what makes a changed credential
 * reach the next operation without a restart.
 * @param ref - the reference to resolve.
 * @returns the value and its source, or `undefined` while unconfigured.
 */
abstract resolve(ref: CredentialRef): Promise<ResolvedCredential | undefined>

/**
 * Describe one reference for configuration surfaces without exposing the
 * value.
 * @param ref - the reference to describe.
 * @returns configured state, supplying source, and writability.
 */
abstract describe(ref: CredentialRef): Promise<CredentialInfo>

/**
 * Durably store one value in the provider-managed writable source. Rejects
 * while a read-only source shadows the reference — the write would appear
 * to succeed while resolution keeps returning the shadowing value — and
 * rejects an empty value (use {@link unset}).
 * @param ref - the reference to store.
 * @param value - the non-empty secret value.
 */
abstract set(ref: CredentialRef, value: string): Promise<void>

/**
 * Remove one reference from the provider-managed writable source; removing
 * an absent reference is a no-op. Rejects while a read-only source shadows
 * the reference, like {@link set}.
 * @param ref - the reference to remove.
 */
abstract unset(ref: CredentialRef): Promise<void>
```

### `credentials/*` events

<a id="credentialsupdated--emit"></a>

#### `credentials/updated` — emit

Committed change to a provider-managed credential source: a `set`, an `unset`, or an external edit observed in storage. Ambient process-environment changes are not observable and never emit. Listener failures are contained and logged — a sync throw and an async rejection alike — without changing the committed operation's outcome, except `INVARIANT`-coded failures, which rethrow after every listener ran; that rethrow reaches the emitter only from synchronous listeners, so invariant checks on this event must not be async functions.
