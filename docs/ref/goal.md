## Cordis API

Generated from source by `scripts/gen-cordis-catalog.ts` (verified fresh by `pnpm run verify-cordis-catalog` in doc-sync; regenerate with `pnpm run gen-cordis-catalog`) — this section is byte-identical in both language sides of the page. Signature blocks use a `ts cordis-catalog` fence and keep the original source JSDoc; dispatch modes are defined in the [primer](../cordis-primer.md#dispatch-modes), and the framework-inherited `ctx` API lives in [cordis-api/inherited.md](../cordis-api/inherited.md).

### `ctx.goals` — `GoalService`

Goal service (`ctx.goals`) backed exclusively by the owning session log.

```ts cordis-catalog
/**
 * Read the current goal for one exact live agent.
 * @param agent - owning live agent.
 * @returns a fresh view or `undefined` when no goal is current.
 * @throws {@link GoalError} when the agent is not the registry's live instance.
 */
get(agent: Agent): GoalView | undefined

/**
 * Remove process-local continuation authority without changing durable goal
 * phase or revision. Lifecycle owners use this before unloading a driver;
 * a later human-authorized {@link resume} records the new activation edge.
 * @param agent - owning live agent.
 * @returns a fresh disarmed view, or `undefined` when no goal is current.
 */
disarm(agent: Agent): GoalView | undefined

/**
 * Create and arm a goal. A completed goal may be replaced; every other
 * current phase must be cleared or resumed instead.
 * @param agent - owning live agent.
 * @param request - objective and optional round cap.
 * @returns the created live view.
 */
create(agent: Agent, request: CreateGoalRequest): GoalView

/**
 * Edit objective and/or round cap without changing phase.
 * @param agent - owning live agent.
 * @param ref - expected current revision.
 * @param request - at least one replacement field.
 * @returns the edited view.
 */
@Remote('edit') edit(agent: Agent, ref: GoalRef, request: EditGoalRequest): GoalView

/**
 * Pause an active goal and disarm automatic continuation.
 * @param agent - owning live agent.
 * @param ref - expected current revision.
 * @returns the paused view.
 */
@Remote('pause') pause(agent: Agent, ref: GoalRef): GoalView

/**
 * Resume and arm a stopped goal, or rearm an active goal after a
 * session-start edge, while its round budget still has capacity.
 * @param agent - owning live agent.
 * @param ref - expected current revision.
 * @returns the active view.
 */
@Remote('resume') resume(agent: Agent, ref: GoalRef): GoalView

/**
 * Mark a current non-complete goal complete and disarm it.
 * @param agent - owning live agent.
 * @param ref - expected current revision.
 * @returns the completed view.
 */
@Remote('complete') complete(agent: Agent, ref: GoalRef): GoalView

/**
 * Mark an active goal blocked and disarm it.
 * @param agent - owning live agent.
 * @param ref - expected current revision.
 * @param reason - policy-owned stable code and human-readable explanation.
 * @returns the blocked view with its durable reason.
 */
block(agent: Agent, ref: GoalRef, reason: GoalBlockReason): GoalView

/**
 * Clear the current goal while retaining a durable tombstone and history.
 * @param agent - owning live agent.
 * @param ref - expected current revision.
 * @returns the tombstone ref whose revision is one past the cleared snapshot.
 */
@Remote('clear') clear(agent: Agent, ref: GoalRef): GoalRef

/**
 * Create one Goal through the remote boundary.
 * @param agent - exact live Agent resolved from the wire identity.
 * @param request - objective and optional round cap.
 * @returns the created Goal identity.
 */
@Remote('create') remoteExportCreate(agent: Agent, request: CreateGoalRequest): CreateGoalResult

### `goal/*` events

<a id="goalchanged--emit"></a>

#### `goal/changed` — emit

Goal mutation accepted by one live agent. The matching `goal/change` session event has already committed. Listener failures are contained. Scope-filtered dispatch (`@deepseek-ai/dsh-scope`): agent-scoped listeners receive only that agent.

```ts cordis-catalog
/**

 * Scope-filtered dispatch (`@deepseek-ai/dsh-scope`): agent-scoped listeners receive only that agent.
 * @param payload.agent - agent whose session owns the goal.
 * @param payload.change - fresh current projection or clear tombstone.
 * @mode emit
