## Cordis API

Generated from source by `scripts/gen-cordis-catalog.ts` (verified fresh by `pnpm run verify-cordis-catalog` in doc-sync; regenerate with `pnpm run gen-cordis-catalog`) — this section is byte-identical in both language sides of the page. Signature blocks use a `ts cordis-catalog` fence and keep the original source JSDoc; dispatch modes are defined in the [primer](../cordis-primer.md#dispatch-modes), and the framework-inherited `ctx` API lives in [cordis-api/inherited.md](../cordis-api/inherited.md).

### `ctx.planMode` — `PlanModeController`

`ctx.planMode`: owns logged plan state, applies and narrates selected state at step start, the `plan:policy` section, the `/plan` command, and the stable exit tool. UIs observe committed flips through `session/event`; there is no live mirror.

```ts cordis-catalog
/**
 * Read the logged plan state and any selected state awaiting the next
 * accepted in-turn pre-step.
 *
 * @param agent The agent to read.
 * @returns Current logged state plus a pending selection, when present.
 */
get(agent: Agent): { active: boolean; pending?: boolean }

/**
 * Select whether plan mode should be active. Between turns the method
 * appends the change immediately because no in-turn pre-step will run until
 * another prompt starts a turn. The open-turn fold is the idle signal:
 * agent status stays `running` through post-turn checkpointing, when no
 * further in-turn pre-step runs. During an open turn the selection remains
 * pending until the next accepted in-turn pre-step. Repeated selection of
 * the current or already-pending state is a no-op.
 *
 * @param agent The agent to switch.
 * @param active Whether plan mode should be active.
 * @returns what happened: `committed` (logged now), `queued` (awaiting the
 * next accepted in-turn pre-step), `cancelled` (an opposite pending selection
 * was cleared; the logged state already matches), or `noop` (already in that
 * state).
 */
set(agent: Agent, active: boolean): 'committed' | 'queued' | 'cancelled' | 'noop'
```
