## Cordis API

Generated from source by `scripts/gen-cordis-catalog.ts` (verified fresh by `pnpm run verify-cordis-catalog` in doc-sync; regenerate with `pnpm run gen-cordis-catalog`) — this section is byte-identical in both language sides of the page. Signature blocks use a `ts cordis-catalog` fence and keep the original source JSDoc; dispatch modes are defined in the [primer](../cordis-primer.md#dispatch-modes), and the framework-inherited `ctx` API lives in [cordis-api/inherited.md](../cordis-api/inherited.md).

### `ctx.settings` — `SettingsProvider` (abstract seam)

Abstract settings service. Providers implement raw-document storage (`load`/`persist`) and push external changes through Settings.publish; the base class owns namespace registration, resolution, validation, change detection, and the `settings/updated` commit event.

```ts cordis-catalog
/**
 * Prepare the provider's user-editable document for a native editor. File
 * providers may materialize an absent document before returning its path;
 * non-file providers return undefined.
 * @returns the absolute local document path, or undefined for non-file storage.
 */
prepareDocument(): Promise<string | undefined>

/**
 * Register a namespace schema and receive its owner scope. The registration
 * is an effect on the calling plugin's fiber: disposing that fiber removes
 * the namespace and its observers. An invalid stored section fails the
 * registration itself — the earliest point where the schema can judge it.
 * @param ns - unique namespace; duplicate registration fails loud.
 * @param schema - schemastery schema resolving this namespace's value.
 * @param options - composition `base` layer and effect timing.
 * @returns the owner scope for reads, observation, and updates.
 */
register<T>(ns: SettingsNamespace, schema: z<T>, options?: SettingsRegisterOptions<T>): SettingsScope<T>

/**
 * Describe every registered namespace for configuration surfaces, including
 * the composition `base` and raw user layers so a form can mark which fields
 * the user overrode (presence in `user`) and what a reset returns to.
 * @param options - redaction switch; wire surfaces must redact.
 * @returns one descriptor per registered namespace, in registration order.
 */
describe(options?: SettingsDescribeOptions): SettingsDescriptor[]

/**
 * Read one registered namespace's resolved value.
 * @param ns - the namespace to read.
 * @returns the resolved value, or `undefined` while unregistered.
 */
get(ns: SettingsNamespace): unknown

/**
 * Merge a patch into one registered namespace's user layer, validate the
 * resolved candidate, persist through the provider, then commit and emit.
 * A validation failure rejects before anything is persisted. Writes to one
 * namespace are serialized: concurrent updates apply in call order, each
 * merging over the previous write's committed section.
 * @param ns - the registered namespace to update.
 * @param patch - plain-object patch over the user section.
 * @param expectedRevision - the descriptor `revision` the caller read; a
 *   namespace that moved past it rejects with {@link SettingsConflictError}.
 */
async update(ns: SettingsNamespace, patch: object, expectedRevision?: number): Promise<void>

/**

 * persist, then commit and emit. Keys absent from `section` fall back to the
 * composition `base` and schema defaults — this is the removal/reset path a
 * merge-only patch cannot express (`replace({})` re-inherits everything).
 * @param ns - the registered namespace to replace.
 * @param section - the complete next user section.
 * @param expectedRevision - the descriptor `revision` the caller read; a
 *   namespace that moved past it rejects with {@link SettingsConflictError}.

/**
 * Apply path-addressed edits to one registered namespace's user section,
 * validate, persist, then commit and emit. The ops are applied to the
 * section as it stands when the write reaches the front of the queue, so a
 * caller never has to restate fields it did not touch — and, crucially,
 * cannot delete fields it never saw. This is the write path for any caller
 * holding a redacted view; `replace` remains the wholesale reset.
 * @param ns - the registered namespace to edit.
 * @param ops - ordered path edits; later ops observe earlier ones.
 * @param expectedRevision - the descriptor `revision` the caller read; a
 *   namespace that moved past it rejects with {@link SettingsConflictError}.

### `settings/*` events

<a id="settingsdocument-updated--emit"></a>

#### `settings/document-updated` — emit

One registered namespace's RAW user section changed, whether or not the resolved value did. `settings/updated` is the consumer-facing event and stays deep-equal-gated; this one exists for configuration surfaces, which must learn that a field went from inherited to overridden (same resolved value, different meaning) and that their held revision is stale. Listener containment matches `settings/updated`.

```ts cordis-catalog
/**
 * One registered namespace's RAW user section changed, whether or not the
 * resolved value did. `settings/updated` is the consumer-facing event and
 * stays deep-equal-gated; this one exists for configuration surfaces,
 * which must learn that a field went from inherited to overridden (same
 * resolved value, different meaning) and that their held revision is
 * stale. Listener containment matches `settings/updated`.
 * @param ns - the namespace whose stored section changed.
 * @param revision - the namespace's new revision.
 * @mode emit

```

<a id="settingsupdated--emit"></a>

#### `settings/updated` — emit

Committed change to one registered namespace's resolved value. Emitted after the provider persisted (for `update`) or published (`provider`) the change; never emitted when the resolved value is deep-equal. Listener failures are contained and logged — a sync throw and an async rejection alike — except `INVARIANT`-coded failures, which rethrow after every listener ran; that rethrow reaches the emitter only from synchronous listeners, so invariant checks on this event must not be async functions.
